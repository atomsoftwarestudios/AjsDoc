Currently, the Ajs Visual Studio Project is included here and the last recent version of the Ajs is in this repository because of debugging purposes.

This repository is under construction and both projects are still in early development phase.

This application can be used as an example for the AjsFramework (https://github.com/atomsoftwarestudios/ajs)

The JSON data are required to be generated with the TypeDoc (https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc)

# Compilation

The project is the Visual Studio solution and should not be a problem to clone:

```
https://github.com/atomsoftwarestudios/AjsDoc.git
```

compile it and run/debug in both, debug and release vesrions under the local IIS Express. Please note the full version of VS (Enterprise, Standard, Community or Express for Web) with the latest TypeScipt tools must be used. Please, report all issues with the compilation and running.
