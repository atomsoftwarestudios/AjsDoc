# ajsDoc
TypeScript documentation browser

Currently, the Ajs Visual Studio Project is included here and the last recent version of the Ajs is in this repository because of debugging purposes.

This repository is under construction and both projects are still in early development phase.

This application can be used as an example for the AjsFramework (https://github.com/atomsoftwarestudios/ajs)

The JSON data are required to be generated with the TypeDoc (https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc)

# Compilation

The porject is the Visual Studio solution and should not be a problem to clone:

```
https://github.com/atomsoftwarestudios/AjsDoc.git
```

and compile it. Please note the full version of VS (Enterprise, Standard, Community or Express for Web) with the latest TypeScipt tools must be used.

# Contribution

Contribution is wellcome, but its provbably too early.
