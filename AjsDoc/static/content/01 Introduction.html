    <p>
        AJS (pronounce /aɪs/) is JavaScript Single Page Application framework written in TypeScript focused to the rapid web browser application development. The resulting code
        is still pure JavaScript (current target is ES5) so its features and possibilities were taken to the account during the development.
    </p>

    <p>
        As it was required to support older versions of web browsers (mainly ie 10+, because Edge is still not fully completed) there are no features like
        Promises or Service Workers used at this time but it should not take long to update the framework to support these technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
        The code was designed to be as simple as possible so no special features of the TypeScript language, like decorators, were not used. Also, there is no need to externally
        inject anything to anywhere or load external libraries unless you specifically need it.
    </p>

    <p>
        The data binding is not and will not be supported directly by the framework as there is no direct support for it in the JavaScript (it is still necessary to anotate the
        data with getters and setters what would not be that bad as need of converting arrays to object structures in order to be possible to monitor its changes - hopefully once 
        we will get indexers as they are implemented in the C#)
    </p>

    <p>
        The ouptut code is not optimized as author wish, because although the TypeScript compiler is great it is still not ideal, but hopefully we can live with it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Set of build tools will grow as there will be need for it (ie. plans for the preprocessor allowing IFDEFS exists, but it will take a while to be developed). It will be
        mainly focused on the Visual Studio and MS Build so if you would like to have also other enviroments you have to contribute ;)
