            Please note the AjsDoc is the example application for the Ajs framework so it is available in offline mode too. It currently consumes about 3 megabytes of the local storage
            for all (unoptimized) resources it is using so if you don't want to have these data stored in your browser you have to clean the application cache using developer tools or the
            JavaScript console ( localStorage.clean() ). It is also using the Application Cache feature where it consumes about  so there are other few files stored there.

    <p>
        AJS (pronounce /aɪs/) is JavaScript MVVM Single Page Application framework written in TypeScript focused to the rapid web browser application development, team role separation, offline
        web applications and great user experience. It is developed with TypeScript (currently 2.5.1) with transpillation target ECMA5 and focusing standard web browsers.
    </p>

    <p>
        The code is written in the C# way so classes and interfaces are split to separate files and the design of the code overall is similar to the C#. Also, the MVVM concept has its inspiration
        in "Windows Forms" or the Borland "Delphi" concept (its probably more similiar to WPF as it is using separate language for template definition) except the data binding which is not supported
        now. The view state is managed in the React way but it is extended about templating in separate HTML files instead of JSXs. Ofcourse, everything is adopted to the Web environment so all the
        Web and Browser functionalities known to web users will stay the same.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ajs currently does not support any "dependency" loader such as require.js so the dependency and initialization of 3rd party libraries must be done manually according the documentation. Of course,
        other methods, like webpack, can be used to for the JavaScript single library package preparation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Set of development tools will grow as there will be need for it. Everything will be focused on the Visual Studio and MS Build and the Windows platform but another fork to support other
        development tools, IDEs and platforms can be maintained by the community.
