	- Redirection Support (currently simple without RegExps, will be updated soon)

- Application management
	- Automatic application loading, configuration and instantiation
	- User configuration is loaded during the boot process
	- BeforeUnload event passed to the application to perform appropriate actions

- Event "delegate"
	- Notifier based on Subscribe / Unsubcribe functionality

- MVVM
	- View
		- Full support of templating features
		- Automatic DOM updating based on View Component state changes
			- Only changed elements / attributes / text nodes are updated for the maximum performance
			
	- View Component (view model)
		- Full support of templting features
		- Automated & queued state management
			- State filtering prior the state is applied to the View Component

	- Model

- Simple application / session state manager
	- Using the Resource Manager features
	- Key / Value storage for the application data to persist between F5 refreshes, manual addressbar
		updates or browser restarting

- Templating
	- new terminology is used to support the innovative approach to templating:
	    Visual Style (CSS), Visual Component (HTML), View Component (Model View / Code behind), View (TS Class manangin the view)
	- support for Visual Style related resources managed by the resource manager
	- Dynamic Visual Style state representation of the Visual Component is determined by the CSS rules and TAG attributes only
		- its not necessary to manipulate tag classes from the code anymore, just to set the visual state properties correctly
          and map them to the tag visual style state attributes
	- Support for separate Visual Styles for various templates as
		- style tag directly in the template
		- stylesheets attribute within the template tag

Accepted change requests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#01/201701 HIGH
- Remove the resource option within the CSS template and rather check if url('...') is a cached resource and use it
	- This will require redesign of the resource manager to keep urls of released resources

- Rework resource manager
    - Add create/remove managed resource function

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Untagged ToDo's & Ideas
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Get rid of all warnings reported by the Visual Studio Intellisense

- Documentation
	- Code documentation
		- Finish the code documentation for the existing code

	- How it works

	- Visual Studio project and compilation
		- Tools & toolchain

	- Coding guidelines

	- Browser application caching

- Resource management
	- performance optiomizations
		- creating the string of specified length in the StorageBrowser.cleanCache can be optimized for ES6
		- multiple calls of getResource during single operation can be optimized
		- review cycles
	- Implement state management
		- Implement application state resource storage

- View, View Components, Visual Components
	- Don't render the component tag to the output
		- will be hard to achieve as root node is needed at this time
	- Move IFs from Template to the View Component
		- This is idea now, not designed, how it should work
	- View state modifications queuing to prevent async operation fighting
	- ViewComponent._getState -> implement function to collect the state information from the view component tree
	- Dynamic View Component -> implement a component allowing to set the view component programatically, not just from template

- Helper libraries -> Implement or reuse?
	- UI
	- Data
		- Data binding???
		- Data validation helpers
	- WebSockets
	- Geo location
	- Push notifications

----

- Javascript minification
- Template compiler / minifier
- Style compiler
- Language & translation transpiller
- Code optimalizations

FAR FUTURE:
- Caching of processed objects - especially visualComponents and view components, dom??

----

Optimizations:
	
A lot of optimizations can be done, at least:

a) Template class - when it is getting components, children components and placeholders
it is browsing the DOM structure multiple times. This can be done in a single step.

b) ViewComponent - while creating a new array of components it calls functions to
get viewcomponent constructor and visual constructor in the loop, this can be done just
once

c) if undefined && not null can be optimized at many places
