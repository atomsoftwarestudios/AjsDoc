<h1>Visual Studio Solution Setup for Application developers</h1>

<p>It is currently too early to provide this information as the framework is still under development.</p>

<p>It is planned the Visual Studio Project template for Ajs Web Application projects will be released including all settings and tools for Debug / Release configurations.</p>

<p>For some additional tasks, such as minification, it will be probably necessary to use Node.js and some kind of JavaScript tools so the basic guide for installation and tool setup and usage is planned</p>
