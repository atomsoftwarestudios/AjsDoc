<h1>Visual Studio Solution Setup for Contributors</h1>

<p>Both projects, (Ajs Framework and Ajs doc) are currently maintained together on GitHub as a single VS solution including 4 projects and some additional tools.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>
    The Visual Studio should be in version 2015 (Enterprise, Professional, Community) - curently tested with Enterprise version.
</p>
    
<p>
    The TypeScript 2.1.5 extension must be installed (https://www.typescriptlang.org/#download-links).
</p>

<p>
    GitHub extension for Visual Studio is highly recommended (https://visualstudio.github.com/)
</p>

<p>
    Currently, there is no need to use any additional tools, task runners or whatever else so with the correct
    version of the Visual Studio and extensions installed it should be possible to download or clone the project
    from the GitHub, open the solution in Visual Studio and directly compile it and run.
</p>

<h3>Project structure</h3>

<p>
    The solution itself is splitted to 4 separate projects:

    <ul>
        <li>Ajs - The Ajs Framework itself</li>
        <li>Ajs Lib - 3rd party libraries (currently only es6-promise) and the libinit for correct library initialization (there is currently no support for some dependency loaders)</li>
        <li>AjsDoc - The TypeScript documentation project</li>
        <li>AjsDoc Lib - 3rd party libraries used within AjsDoc (currently only highlightpack.js) and the libinit for correct library initialization (there is currently no support for some dependency loaders)</li>
    </ul>

</p>

<p>
    All projects are stored in the following "strange" folder structure but it is necessary for correct source mapping and easy debugging (just important files and folders noted.)

            .ajsNoListStyle ul {
                list-style: none;
                padding-left: 1em;
            }

            .ajsNoListStyle li {

<h3>Compilation and build tool chain</h3>
<p>
    TypeScript compilation is fully driven using TSConfigs now, previously it was using the VS project properties. Both, Debug and Release configurations are supported (there is pre-build command creating
    the right tsconfig before compilation).
</p>

<p>
    Resource pre-compilation tools (like stylesheet processors) are not used at this time
</p>

<p>
    Post-build tool for the resulting code optimalization is currently missing, but planned to be developed. It will be a post processor of the generated JS code and it is planned to do following tasks:
    <ul>
        <li>Debug support and logging removal</li>
        <li>JS optimalizations for shorter code (joining same namespaces together, defineProperty -> defineProperties)</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    There is also a tool for the manifest.cache file generation in the pos-built chain - the file is regenerated after each build.    
</p>

<p>
    For AjsDoc, there is TocGen for generation of the table of contents from the existing folder structure.
</p>

<p>
    No task runners are currently used (except MSBuild pre-build and post-build).
    The rest of the tool chain depends on developer needs. If minification of js / resources will be required it would be probably best way to use node.js and tools like uglify.
</p>

<h3>Tools</h3>

<p>The tool for conversion from UTF-8 with BOM to UTF is added but is supposed to be run manually. Visual Studio stores all files in UTF-8 with BOM by default and this can cause unexpected problems, especially during debugging with map files.</p>
