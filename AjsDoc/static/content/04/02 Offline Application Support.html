<h1>Offline Application Support</h1>

<p>
    Offline application support was one of main requiremets the framework has to fullfil. The support is currently based on the Application Cache browser feature,
    what is going to be deprecated and removed from web browsers. Once this will happen the framework will switch to Service Workers technology, what in the end
    will have no impact to existing applications usig AJS as this change will be transparent to them (of course only if application will be properly designed and
    will follow AJS best practices).
</p>

<p>
    The Application Cache is based on the manifest file with details describing what files should be cached and used in offline mode and another details. For
    details see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Using_the_application_cache" target="_blank">Using the application cache</a> article at
    the MDN site.
</p>

<p>
    Resources which were cahced to the Application Cache are never updated until the appcache.manifest file is modified. The post-build tool is included in the tools
    directory and updates the appcache.manifest file automatically when:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>index.html file is modified or</li>
    <li>ajs.js file is modified or</li>
    <li>ajs.boot.config.js file is modified or</li>
    <li>favicon.ico file is modified or</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Only files mentioned above are stored in the application cache. Other files (such as application resources) are managed by AJS Resource Manager if the
    application does not use any different approach.
</p>

<p>
    The following chart less or more describes how the Application Cache works in the browser. In the end of initial HTTP request (when all resources are loaded = 
    window.onload event) the ajs.boot._boot() function is executed to load the application itself, application resources, initialize the framework and application
    and start the application by routing to appropriate view.
