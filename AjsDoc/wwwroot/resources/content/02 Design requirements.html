<h1>Design requirements</h1>

<p>
    Before the decision was made and development of the framework begun some requirements were defined and other frameworks
    were searched to support them. Many of them partially supports them, but there is no framework fully
    fits requirements of the targetted project. The following list contains a few of them:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        As short as possible learning curve
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
        Single Page “Heavy” Client JS application framework
        <ul>
            <li>The application must be fully running on the remote device in browser, possibly offline.</li>
        </ul>        
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>As small as possible, ideally up to 150kB ungzipped</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
        Browser support
        <ul>
            <li>IE10+ / Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari (including mobile versions)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
        Offline support
        <ul>
            <li>Full web applications or at least parts of them should be possible to run offline with a minimal efort during implementation</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
        No requiremnt on server side rendering at all.
        <ul>
            Only code, resources and the data should be transferred over network.
            The application must be fully running on the remote device in the browser and should be able to render from templates itself
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
        Complete code base
        <ul>
            <li>Not a collection of tons of independent libraries from various developers built together using some dependency loader</li>
            <li>Support for 3rd party libraries</li>
            <li>It should be possible to maintain it in-house</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
        Well designed and developed, ideally with a good support

        <ul>
            <li>
                Separation of concerns and possibly of team roles
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML should be HTML, ideally completely separated from the code and the view logic</li>
                    <li>Separation of layers based on MVC or MVVM</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                HTML / CSS / DOM
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML templating must be easy. Ideally "coding" free (logicless) without tons of additional tags and attributes so web designers can use it without need of learning so much stuff.</li>
                    <li>Manipulation of DOM should not be necessary form the application (but possible)</li>
                    <li>From the application, nothing like createElement or $(… should be necessary - but of course possible</li>
                    <li>Frameworks / Libraries like jquery should be avoided but possible to use</li>
                    <li>Reusable HTML/CSS components</li>
                    <li>CSS frameworks should be usable with no impact</li>
                    <li>Stylesheets must be used at maximum level. Avoding manipulation of the style attribute is the big plus</li>
                    <li>DOM should be ideally manipulated only automatically based on the template and the data</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                Testable code
            </li>

            <li>
                Typed language such as TypeScript
            </li>

            <li>
                Build tool chain should be limited as much as possible (it would be possible to use Node, NPM and tons of tools, but better if it will not be necessary)
            </li>

            <li>
                Complete and easy accessible debugging possibilities with break points and another nice stuff in some full featured IDE
            </li>

            <li>
                Well documented and ideally supported
            </li>

            <li>
                Ready for extensions and migrations (i.e. to ES6)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
  
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
        Browser must still work as a browser.
        <ul>
            <li>It’s still a web. So for the maximum possible User Experience keep it as a web.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>


<ul>
    <li>
        It should be simple to use and optimized for rapid application development.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Reusability of templates and the view components code is a must
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
        Easy language and translation support
        <ul>
            <li>
                It should be simple to translate the application to a different language.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
        As less as possible data transfers between the client and server
        <ul>
            <li>
                Data &amp; and resource caching, ideally controllable from the application, is a must
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
