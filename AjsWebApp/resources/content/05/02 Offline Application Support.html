<h1>Offline Application Support</h1>

<p>
    Offline application support was one of main requiremets the framework has to fullfil. The support is currently based on the Application Cache browser feature
    and Ajs Framework <a href="/04-How-it-works/03-Boot-Process" onclick="return ajs.Framework.navigator.linkClicked(event)">boot process control</a> and
    <a href="/04-How-it-works/05-Resource-Management-and-Caching" onclick="return ajs.Framework.navigator.linkClicked(event)">resource management.</a>
</p>

<p>
    Application Cache feature is deprecated and will be removed from web browsers. Once this will happen the framework will switch to Service Workers technology, what
    in the end will have no impact to existing applications usig AJS as this change will be transparent to them (of course only if application will be properly designed and
    will follow Ajs Application Development practices).
</p>

<p>
    The Application Cache is based on the manifest file with details describing what files should be cached and used in offline mode and another details. For
    details see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Using_the_application_cache" target="_blank">Using the application cache</a> article at
    the MDN site.
</p>

<p>
    Resources which were cahced to the Application Cache are never updated until the appcache.manifest file is modified. The post-build tool is included in the tools
    directory and updates the appcache.manifest file automatically when:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>index.html file is modified or</li>
    <li>ajs.js file is modified or</li>
    <li>ajs.boot.config.js file is modified or</li>
    <li>favicons or appplication manifests file are modified</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Only files mentioned above are stored in the application cache. Other files (such as application resources) are managed by AJS Resource Manager if the
    application does not use any different approach.
</p>

<p>
    Once the application gets offline there is fallback section defined in the cache manifest file which redirects all requests to index.html page (better said
    to the root of the web - /). All resources requested in the offline mode are then handled as the index.html file (even if request for image is made).
    In order to be possible to recognize the applicaion is oflline and cached resource should be returned (instead of index.html) the resource loader inspects
    the resource content returned by the browser and is checking for &lt;!--offline--&gt; tag in first 50 bytes of loaded resource. If the offline marker is found
    the resource loader returns 304 - Not modified and Resource Manager returns the appropriate resource from the cache instead of returning the resource provided
    by the browser application cache (index.html). It means the index.html file has to contain this offline marker the in order the application work properly.
    The index.html should look like the following example:
    
<pre class="ajsDocExample"><code class="html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;!--offline--&gt;
&lt;html lang="en" manifest="/cache.manifest"&gt;
...
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
    The following chart less or more accurately describes how the Application Cache works in the browser. In the end of initial HTTP request (when all resources
    are loaded = window.onload event) the ajs.boot._boot() function is executed to load the application itself, application resources, initialize the framework
    and application and start the application by routing to appropriate view.
